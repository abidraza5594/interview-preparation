# Netlify Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites
1. Create a Netlify account at https://netlify.com
2. Install Netlify CLI (optional): `npm install -g netlify-cli`

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Drag and Drop Deployment (Easiest)
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Click "Add new site" → "Deploy manually"
3. Drag and drop the `dist/interview/browser` folder to the deployment area
4. Your site will be deployed instantly!

### Option 2: Git-based Deployment (Recommended for continuous deployment)
1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
2. Go to https://app.netlify.com
3. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
4. Connect your Git provider and select your repository
5. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `ng build --configuration production`
   - Publish directory: `dist/interview/browser`
   - Node version: 18
6. Click "Deploy site"

### Option 3: Netlify CLI Deployment
1. Install Netlify CLI: `npm install -g netlify-cli`
2. Login: `netlify login`
3. Deploy: `netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist/interview/browser`

## Build Configuration
The project includes:
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration file
- `_redirects` - Angular routing configuration
- Production build optimizations

## Post-Deployment
1. Your site will get a random URL like `https://amazing-name-123456.netlify.app`
2. You can change the site name in Netlify dashboard
3. Add a custom domain if needed

## Environment Variables (if needed)
If your app uses environment variables:
1. Go to Site settings → Environment variables
2. Add your variables (API keys, etc.)

## Troubleshooting
- If routes don't work: Check `_redirects` file
- If build fails: Check Node version and dependencies
- If styles are missing: Check asset paths
